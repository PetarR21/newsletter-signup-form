## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to implement form validation in React and provide feedback to users. I also practiced managing component state and conditional rendering for success messages.

### Continued development

I would like to improve the code, so it is more robust and clean.
